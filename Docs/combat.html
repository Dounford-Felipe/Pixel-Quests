<h2>Including Pixel Shop+</h2>
<p>First, you need to grab the require link for the latest version of the script. Head over to Greasy Fork <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/491625-pixel-combat">https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/491625-pixel-combat</a> and copy the bit that starts with // @require, but remove the ?version=whatever bit at the end. This needs to be added to your script's metadata (on top of the script). If you wish to target a specific version however, you can leave the ?version in - but this is not recommended as it can lead to multiple versions of the library being included and conflicting with each other.</p>

<h2>Creating Enemies</h2>
<p><b>All enemies follow a pattern of how they should be created</b></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//This is a enemy with all possible keys:
enemyName: {
	name:'Enemy Name',
	image:"https://example.com/example.png",
	hp:1,
	maxHp:1,
	accuracy:0,
	damage:1,
	speed:3,
	defence:0,
	multiPhase: false,
	nextPhase:'',
	arrowImunity:false,
	magicImunity:false,
	needsLight:false,
	defender: false,
	weakToFire:false,
	weakToIce:false,
	ghost: false,
	fish: false,
	lootTable: "",
	lootFunction: "",
	winFunction: "",
	abilities: []
}

//Use this as a template, if there is any missing key the script will use the default enemy stats.
</code></pre>

<h2>Basic Stats</h2>
<p>These are the stats that don't have special properties.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">name:'Enemy Name', //The displayed Name
image:"https://example.com/example.png", //The image shown during the fight, 500x600px is the perfect resolution
hp:1, //How much hp the enemy stats with, can't be higher than maxHp
maxHp:1, //The maximum HP the enemy can get
accuracy:0, //The change of hitting the player
damage:1, //The maximum damage each hit can get
speed:3, //How fast it attacks
defence:0 //The change of dodging the player attack 
</code></pre>

<h2>Immunities and Penalties</h2>
<p>These are stats that grant Immunities to the enemy or apply Debuffs to the player.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">arrowImunity:false, //If true every ranged attack will miss
magicImunity:false, //If true it can't be damaged with spells
needsLight:false, //If true and Latern or Ring of Light are not equiped the player will receive a penalty on Hit Chance
defender: false //If true the player will loss 1 HP each successful hit
</code></pre>

<h2>Weakness</h2>
<p>These are stats that change the amound of damage inflicted on the enemy</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">weakToFire:false, //If true Fire based attacks and spells with inflict double damage
weakToIce:false, //If true Ice based attacks and spells with inflict double damage
ghost: false, //If true Scythe with inflict double damage and Double Scythe 4x damage
fish: false //If true Tridents will inflict double damage
</code></pre>

<h2>Loot</h2>
<p>This can be used if your script has any type of custom loot</p>
<p>The lootFunction can be useless, but it needs to exist if you want the loot to be displayed</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//You can add as many items to as you want, the format is as follow:
lootTable: [lootableItems]
let lootableItem1 = {
	item:'testLoot', //The item name, this will be returned if the player get any
	image:'https://example.com/exampleLoot.png', //Image displayed if the player get any
	min:1, //The minimum amount of the item the player can get
	max:10, //The maximum amount of the item the player can get
	chance:0.5 //The change of getting the item (0-1)
}
lootTable: [lootableItem1,lootableItem2,lootableItem100]

lootFunction: function(){IdlePixelPlus.plugins.myplugin.myFunction()} //This function will be called with the loot as objects inside a single array
Example of how the function will be called: lootFunction([{item:'basalt',amount:20}, {item:'jade',amount:2}, {item:'jasmin',amount:560}])
//In case you don't need/want this feature you can have both lootTable and lootFunction as empty strings
</code></pre>

<h2>Win Function</h2>
<p>This can be used if you want to call a function after winning the fight</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">winFunction: function(){IdlePixelPlus.plugins.myplugin.myFunction()} //After winning this function will be called
//In case you don't need/want this feature you can have winFunction as empty string
</code></pre>

<h2>Multi Phase</h2>
<p>This can be used to create chainned fights like the Robot Waves</p>
<p><b>The next enemy needs to be defined before the current one</b></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">multiPhase: true, //If true the next enemy will be loaded as soon as the HP of the current enemy reaches 0
nextPhase:enemyName2, //The enemy that will be spawned after the current is defeated
//In case you don't need/want this feature you can have multiPhase as false and nextPhase as empty string
</code></pre>

<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>There are multiple types of abilities, each enemy can have as many as you want, being it different abilities or multiple of the same</p>
<p>The types are: <b><a href="#heal">Heal</a>, <a href="#poison">Poison</a>, <a href="#damage">Damage</a>, <a href="#chargeDamage">Charge Damage</a>, <a href="#lifeSteal">Life Steal</a>, <a href="#invisibility">Invisibility</a>, <a href="#reflect">Reflect</a> and <a href="#kamikaze">Kamikaze</a></b></p>

	cooldown: 3, //The amount of seconds between each use
