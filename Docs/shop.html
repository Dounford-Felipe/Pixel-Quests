<h2>Including Pixel Shop+</h2>
<p>First, you need to grab the require link for the latest version of the script. Head over to Greasy Fork <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/488260-pixelshop">https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/488260-pixelshop</a> and copy the bit that starts with // @require, but remove the ?version=whatever bit at the end. This needs to be added to your script's metadata (on top of the script). If you wish to target a specific version however, you can leave the ?version in - but this is not recommended as it can lead to multiple versions of the library being included and conflicting with each other.</p>

<h2>Loading Currency</h2>
<p><b>This should be done before creating new coins, shops or items</b></p>
<p>Unless you don't need the currency to be saved between sessions you should load the currency amount after the player login</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//If you are using IdlePixel+ you can do something as follow:
onLogin() {
	PixelShopPlus.loadCoins()
}

//Do note that to loadCoins work the var_username needs to exist already, so you need to be careful when you will call it if you are not using IPP
</code></pre>

<h2>Creating new Currency</h2>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//You should start registering your coins, there are no limits as for how many different coins you will use, the format is as follow:

let newCoin = {
	name:"testCoin",
	image:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dounford-Felipe/DHP-Pets/main/images/goldenHeart.gif",
	value:2000
};
PixelShopPlus.newCoin(newCoin);

//You don't need to create a variable:

PixelShopPlus.newCoin({name:'testCoin',image:'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dounford-Felipe/DHP-Pets/main/images/goldenHeart.gif',value:2000});
</code></pre>

<h2>Creating new Shops</h2>
<p>When creating new shops a new tab will appear on the game shop panel, if declared it will show the current value of the main Currency used on the shop.</p>
<p>Do note that even if all shops have a main currency you can create items that use a currency other than the main.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//You can add as many shops as you want, the format is as follow:

PixelShopPlus.newShop(shopName,shopMainCoin);

//It will be something like this:

PixelShopPlus.newShop('testShop','testCoin');
</code></pre>

<h2>Registering new Buyable Items</h2>
<p>When creating new items they will appear on the corresponding shop tab.</p>
<p>Do note that even if all shops have a main currency you can create items that use a currency other than the main.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//You can add as many items to each shop as you want, the format is as follow:
PixelShopPlus.newItems(shopName,[itemObjects]);
let itemObject1 = {
	name:"blueCat2", //The Item name
	imageUrl:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dounford-Felipe/DHP-Pets/main/images/blueCat.png", //The image that will be displayed on shop
	coin:"testCoin", //The currency used to buy the item
	price:1000, //The item price
	tooltipText:"&lt;span class='color-primary'&gt;Blue Cat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cute cat wants to be your friend", //The text that will show when hovering over the item
	buyText:"Adopt this cat to be your friend", //The text that will show when clicking to buy
	boughtText:"Charlie will forever love you", //The text that will show after buying
	bought:false, //If the item is already bought
	callback:function(){IdlePixelPlus.plugins.myplugin.myFunction()} //After buying this function will be called, if you don't need this you can have it as a empty string
}

PixelShopPlus.newItems('testShop',[itemObject1,itemObject2,itemObject100])
</code></pre>

<h2>Removing Buyable Items</h2>
<p>If for some reason you need to remove a buyable item you can use this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//Any item can be removed
PixelShopPlus.removeItem(shopName,itemName);

//The item on shop will be removed too

PixelShopPlus.removeItem('testShop','blueCat2');
</code></pre>

<h2>Changing Currency Amount</h2>
<p>The amount can be changed in 3 different ways: it can increase, decrease or be set to a specific amount.</p>
<p>All changes will <b>1 -</b> Trigger the PixelShopPlus.saveCoins that will save the current amount on localstorage.</p>
<p><b>2 -</b> Update all elements with the attribute coin-value=coinName with the new coin value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//If you want to increase it.
PixelShopPlus.coinIncrease(coinName,amount);

PixelShopPlus.coinIncrease('testCoin',1000);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//If you want to decrease it.
PixelShopPlus.coinDecrease(coinName,amount);

PixelShopPlus.coinDecrease('testCoin',1200);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//If you want to have a defined amount.
PixelShopPlus.coinSet(coinName,amount);

PixelShopPlus.coinSet('testCoin',1432007);
</code></pre>
