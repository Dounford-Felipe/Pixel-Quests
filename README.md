**Pixel Toolbox** is a set of frameworks designed to create a custom experience on Idle Pixel adding making it possible to add new custom enemies, quests and shops. You don't need to use all scripts, each script can work individually

[Anwinity's Idle Pixel+](https://anwinity.com/idlepixelplus/) is not needed, but it will give a better experience for both the developer and the users.

### Toolbox is composed of 3 main scripts:

[Pixel Shop](https://dounford-felipe.github.io/Pixel-Toolbox/shop.html) -- It can add new shop, currency and buyable items.

[Pixel Quests](https://dounford-felipe.github.io/Pixel-Toolbox/quests.html) -- It can add new quests. (coming soon)

[Pixel Combat](https://dounford-felipe.github.io/Pixel-Toolbox/combat.html) -- It can add new enemies and handle custom combats, pvp included. (coming soon)
